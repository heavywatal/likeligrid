- pathway: $i$
    - weight: $w_i$, where $\sum_i w_i = 1$
    - exclusivity:  $x_i$
    - number of mutated sites: $s_i$
- configuration: $j$
    - number of mutated sites: $s_j = \sum_i s_i$
    - unnormalized probability of the configuration:
      $p_j = \prod _i w_i^{s_i} x_i^{\max(0, s_i - 1)}$
    - normalized probability of the configuration:
      $P_j = p_j / D_{s_j}$
    - denominator to normalize probability:
      $D_s = \sum_j^{s = s_j} p_j$.
